“Paul Thomas Annotated: In the Margins” is a digital annotation project devoted to Paul Thomas Anderson’s filmography. It aims to provide pathways into his work by annotating, scene by scene, each of his nine narrative films to date: Hard Eight, Boogie Nights, Magnolia, Punch-Drunk Love, There Will Be Blood, The Master, Inherent Vice, Phantom Thread, and Licorice Pizza. This site is a prototype.
