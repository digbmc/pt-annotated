            Welcome to the beta version of <em>Paul Thomas Annotated: In the Margins</em>, an open access resource devoted to the filmography of Paul Thomas Anderson. Our project involves annotating, scene by scene, screenshots from each of his ten narrative films to date. This website
            is under development, and we welcome user feedback. <a href="{{ '/about.html' | relative_url }}">Learn More <svg class="bi icon-sprite" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="{{ '/assets/lib/icons/arrow-right.svg' | relative_url }}"/></svg></a>
