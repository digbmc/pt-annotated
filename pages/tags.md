### Glossary

#### Angle and Perspective
- **overhead**: very high, shot from directly above
- **high**: shot from above, looking down
- **low**: shot from below, looking up
- **eye-level**: shot head-on
- **dutch**: camera is tilted or canted, frame is not parallel to the horizon
- **point of view**: shot as if it were from a character’s perspective, putting the spectators in their shoes to see the world through their eyes

#### Distance
- **extreme close-up**: shot from very, very close, from chin to forehead for a face without hair or shoulders or showing only a fragment of a face, for example an eye, an object
- **close-up**: shot from very close, as when a face or small object takes up the entire screen
- **medium shot**: shot from a middle distance, usually waist up
- **plan américain**: shot from the knees up, usually appears in westerns
- **full shot**: encompasses the whole body, taking up the screen
- **long shot**: shot from far away, as in a landscape and if there are humans/objects, they are smaller than the size of the screen
- **extreme long shot**: usually akin to panoramic, and if there are humans/objects, they are tiny on the screen
- **establishing shot**: a long shot of a location that informs the spectator where the next scene is about to take place

#### Location
- **interior**: the camera and/or the setting of the shot is indoors
- **exterior**: the camera and/or the setting of the shot is outside

#### Movement
- **fixed**: camera does not move
- **mobile**: camera moves
- **pan**: camera swivels on its horizontal axis without changing its position on the ground
- **tilt**: camera tilts on its vertical axis without changing its position on the ground
- **tracking**: camera moves in any horizontal direction regardless of whether actual track was used during production to create the shot
- **zoom**: shot achieves the same effect as a tracking shot towards or away from an object, but using a special lens instead of moving the camera; NB: for differences between tracking, also called dolly & zoom, please see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKOxbCx1LNc). 
- **crane**: camera as a whole moves vertically up or down, or may move around in 360-degree space regardless of whether an actual crane was used in production. This tag also applies to shots captured with a drone.
- **handheld**: camera that usually gives the impression of perspective, as if someone were holding the camera—sometimes it’s a bit shaky or unstable

#### Lighting
- **high key**: frame is bright, illuminated with no to little shadows
- **low key**: contrast between light and shadow, also called chiaroscuro
- **backlighting**: lit from behind, can look like a halo or a silhouette, depending on how strong the light is

#### Composition
- **single shot**, **two shot**, **three shot**: indicates how many people are in the frame
- **dirty single**: one person figures prominently in the shot, but there may be other people in the background or out of focus
- **group shot**: for the purposes of this project, used for shots of more than three people

#### Duration
- **long take**: a continuous shot that is much longer than the average shot length in a film, often to convey a sense of the action taking place in real time

#### Themes
- **crime**
- **doubles**
- **family**
- **gender**
- **histories**
- **intertextualities**
- **intimacies**
- **location**
- **marginality**
- **media**
- **PTA**
- **religion**
- **systems**
- **violence**
