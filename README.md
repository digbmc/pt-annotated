# Paul Thomas Annotated: In the Margins

*Paul Thomas Annotated: In the Margins* is an open access resource devoted to the filmography of Paul Thomas Anderson. Our project involves annotating, scene by scene, screenshots from each of his ten narrative films to date (*Hard Eight*, *Boogie Nights*, *Magnolia*, *Punch-Drunk Love*, *There Will Be Blood*, *The Master*, *Inherent Vice*, *Phantom Thread*, *Licorice Pizza*, *One Battle After Another)*.

Our website is built with [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/). The images from the films are made available in [International Image Interability Framework (IIIF)](https://iiif.io/) format through a static (level 0) implementation and are compatible with the Presentation API 3.0. Annotations are added to the IIIF manifests with [liiive](https://liiive.now/), and the images along with their annotations are displayed on the site in embedded [Mirador](https://projectmirador.org/) viewers. The collection metadata is available for download in CSV and JSON formats. For reference purposes, each image from the film has been assigned a unique ID based on its film of origin, represented as a four-letter code, and its timestamp, minus the colons. For example, the first image from Punch-Drunk Love has the timestamp 0:00:39, and its ID is PUNC-00039.
