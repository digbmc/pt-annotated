Perhaps PTA’s most charming film, *Licorice Pizza* (2021) found the director returning to his roots—the 1970s San Fernando Valley—for a romp with a precocious actor-turned-impresario, Gary Valentine (Cooper Hoffman), and a young woman struggling to launch, Alana Kane (Alana Haim). The plot spins around their curious relationship even as it catches different grooves and subplots involving local politics, the effects of the oil embargo of 1973, and larger-than-life characters based on Hollywood personalities William Holden and Jon Peters.

Similar to *Inherent Vice*, *Licorice Pizza*’s "hangout film" facade and perfectly calibrated needle drops belie its interests in the tense political, sexual, and social dynamics of the era. Likewise, Gary and Alana’s enigmatic partnership—a whirlwind that finds them struggling to match each other’s rhythm until the film’s brilliantly edited finale—finds them moving from one scheme to another, as the unusual pair comes to embody another version of one of PTA’s archetypical characters: the lonely outsider seeking validation in financial success.
