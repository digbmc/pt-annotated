*There Will Be Blood* (2007) explores a different side of California than Paul Thomas Anderson's other works set in his home state. Combining themes of family, religion, and capitalist drive and its inevitable corrosion, *There Will Be Blood* may be Anderson’s darkest film yet.

Set during the oil rush of the early 19th century, silver-miner-turned-oil-prospector Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) finds success at the Sunday Ranch up in Little Boston, a small fictional town in Northern California where oil sits on the ground. It is at the Sunday Ranch where the central tension of the film is introduced as Plainview clashes with the ranch owner’s extremely devout son, Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), founder of The Church of the Third Revelation. A larger-than-life film becomes grounded in the tenuous relationship between Daniel and Eli, two men who appear on opposite sides, but may be more similar than either would like to believe.
