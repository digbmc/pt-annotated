*Inherent Vice* (2014) adapts Thomas Pynchon’s novel of the same name (2009), bringing the author’s drifting, conspiracy-soaked tone into one of PTA’s most uninhibited films. Set in 1970 Los Angeles County, the hippie movement is in decline and slowly being reshaped by money, institutions, and a creeping sense that the party is ending—whether anyone is ready for it or not.  

Larry “Doc” Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix) is a perpetually-high private investigator whose instinct for kindness and truth survives despite the haziness. When his ex-girlfriend Shasta Fay Hepworth (Katherine Waterston) asks him to help untangle a plot involving her real estate tycoon lover, Doc is pulled into a complicated web of disappearances, cultish institutions, and a mysterious organization called The Golden Fang. As clues accumulate and coherence slips away, *Inherent Vice* becomes less a mystery to be solved than a trip to ride out.
